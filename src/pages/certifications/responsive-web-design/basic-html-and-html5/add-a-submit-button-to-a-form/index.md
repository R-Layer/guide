## Add a Submit Button to a Form

Once the user ends to fill up the fields of a form he needs a way to communicate he's done and the data are ready to be sent; this is the what the attribute `type="submit"` of the `button` HTML element is for <sup>1</sup>  

In this challenge you want to insert the submit button as the last element of the form ( just before the `</form>` closing tag) and to give it the attribute `type="submit"` (everything lowercase) and a text content of "Submit" (first letter uppercase) as specified in the challenge instruction.


1) the value `submit` of the attribute `type` is valid also inside an `input` tag and it will render a button with almost the same behaviour, but this is not the tag you want to use in this challenge
